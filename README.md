## 🧠 Overview

**Jeeva AI** is an AI-powered medical assistant designed to support **doctors**, **radiologists**, and **patients** in analyzing medical images using **Google's Gemini Pro** model. This project showcases how cutting-edge multimodal LLMs like **Gemini** can interpret X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and more — with structured diagnostic support.

Whether you're building a healthcare tool, experimenting with Gemini APIs, or exploring medical image processing, Jeeva AI is the perfect project to get started with.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Gemini Pro Integration**: Leverages Google's latest LLM to interpret medical images with exceptional accuracy.
- 🖼️ **Medical Image Recognition**: Upload X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc., and receive a detailed diagnostic analysis.
- 📝 **Automated Findings Report**: Clear, structured summary of anomalies or signs of disease.
- 🔄 **Treatment Suggestions**: Recommends follow-up tests or treatments (when applicable).
- 💬 **Natural Language Q&A**: Ask the assistant for explanations, clarifications, or condition-related info.

## 🧪 Use Case

This app can be used for:

- 🩺 **Clinical Assistance**: Doctors seeking AI-backed second opinions  
- 👨‍⚕️ **Patient Education**: Simplified explanations of image findings  
- 🧑‍💻 **Developer Inspiration**: LLM-based healthcare projects using Gemini

---

## 🩻 How It Works

1. **Upload Medical Image** (X-ray, MRI, etc.)
2. The app sends the image to **Gemini Pro** via its API
3. Gemini analyzes and returns:
   - Anomalies or disease signs
   - Next step recommendations
   - Treatment suggestions (if relevant)
4. The system displays a structured report + disclaimer
